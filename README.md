## Project Requirements:

Object-Oriented Concepts:
   - Create Classes/Protocols for tasks, implementing properties and methods that encapsulate task-related information and functionalities.
   - Implement inheritance/Composition to manage different types of tasks (e.g., personal, work, shopping) efficiently.

Protocol-Oriented Design:
   - Define protocols that ensure consistent behaviour across different types of tasks.
   - Apply protocol-oriented programming principles to enhance code modularity and reusability.

User Interface (UI) Design:
   - Develop an intuitive UI using SwiftUI, allowing users to add, edit, and delete tasks and task lists.
   - Design visually appealing screens that align with the app's purpose and provide a seamless user experience.

Error Handling:
   - Implement error handling mechanisms to manage scenarios such as incorrect user inputs or network connectivity issues.
   - Ensure the app gracefully communicates errors to users and provides guidance on resolving theme

Testing and Debugging:
   - Write unit tests to verify the functionality of key components, such as task creation, editing, and deletion.
   - Use Xcode's debugging tools to identify and fix any issues that may arise during development.

Version Control:
   - Create a Git repository to track your project's source code history.
   - Commit your changes regularly, providing clear and meaningful commit messages.
